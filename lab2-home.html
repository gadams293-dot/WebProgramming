    <h1>Welcome to Lab 2!</h1>

    <p>
    The purpose of this lab is to train us creating new html pages with consistent naming, proper linking, and proper 
    organization. For this page, we are tasked with adding an h1 welcome header, a paragraph describing the purpose of the lab, 
    and links to several sites using both absolute and ralative paths. The links must include the a relative path link 
    to the lab2-about.html page, an absolute path link to a page of our choice, in my case being the Mozilla home page, 
    and links to the Tri-C Home and IT pages. These links must also be organized into an HTML Table.
